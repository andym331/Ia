		unzip the folder to any location of your choice, by right-clicking on Ia-main.zip and selecting 'Extract All' on Windows, or using a similar method on Mac, such as Archive Utility.
	in the unzipped folder, within Ia-main, double click on IAnkkw_website.html to open it with your default web browser
	Find links that reveal themselves by highlighting as you move the cursor around, and click on them
