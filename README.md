I hope this might inspire you to also find names and images and words and sounds for the experiences and realms that you encounter in our realities : )

### Note:	
- This only works on a computer / laptop (not a smart phone)  
- It's best to set your computer volume at 70 - 100% volume, and if possible please allow auto-play for sounds. Otherwise, this will have to be enabled for each page and then the page reloaded.  
- To find the full text on a single page, click on buttons within the ribbons at the top and bottom of the page  

### How to download this:  
1. Please start by clicking the green 'Code' button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/andym331/Ia)  
From the options, choose 'Download ZIP'  
choose the 'Save File'  
open the file location, likely the Downloads folder on your computer  
2. unzip the folder to any location (by right-clicking on Ia-main.zip and selecting 'Extract All' on Windows, or using a similar method on Mac, such as Archive Utility).  
3. in the unzipped folder, within Ia-main, double click on IAnkkw_website.html to open it with your default web browser  

### How to view and listen:
- Find links that reveal themselves by highlighting as you move the cursor around, and click on them   
- then, return to the main page by using your web browser's back button, when you are done reading / listening to that page.  
- if no audio plays on a page, then instruct your web browser to not block audio, and reload the page.
